# Intro

My name is Jiaxin Ying (应佳欣). I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan. I enjoy learning Mathematics and Computer Science and applying the knowledge to research projects on graph algorithms and natural language processing. Upon graduation from UMich, I hope to pursue a master's degree, and in the future, work on research and development in machine learning and big data.
